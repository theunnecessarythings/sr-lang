# Contributing to sr-lang

Thanks for your interest in contributing to sr-lang!

This project is a learning-driven, experimental programming language and compiler. It is not production-critical, and contributions are not expected to be perfect.

## What This Project Is (and Isn’t)

- ✅ A place to learn about compilers and language design by working on real code
- ✅ Open to exploration, refactoring, and experimentation
- ❌ Not a polished or stable production system
- ❌ Not strict about “the one correct way” to do things

If something looks messy or unfinished, that’s likely intentional.

## Ways to Contribute

Some good starting points include:
- Working on the standard library (`std/`)
- Adding or improving tests
- Writing documentation or examples
- Improving compiler diagnostics
- Refactoring or simplifying existing code

If you’re unsure where to start, feel free to open an issue and ask.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Small, focused pull requests are preferred
- Imperfect or exploratory contributions are welcome
- If you’re changing behavior or syntax, please explain your reasoning in the PR description
- Don’t worry about breaking things — learning and iteration are part of the project

## Getting Help

If you have questions:
- Open an issue
- Ask in a pull request
- Propose an idea, even if it’s half-formed

Curiosity and initiative matter more than polish here.
